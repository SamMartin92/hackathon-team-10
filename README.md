# Code Cupids (Hackathon team 10)
Team repo for Feb Hackathon '24

## **Intro**
The app is designed to allow the users to find romantic places to bring their loved one on valentines day. The app allows the user to find locations world wide. The user enters the country of choice and is then offered a number of location in that country. The user can then search via city or country and is offered locations. The search can be carried out via map or form. The search offers a picture of the location and a brief description about the location. The user can select the specific location and will be offered a more detailed description about the location and an ability to read the reviews from others. The app also offers the user the ability to input their own review and to rate the location.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

## **Planning Stage**
The planning was as follows
  1. Select a project.
  2. Create user stories and dev tasks using Github Kanban board.
  3. Assign user stories to EPICS
  4. Create labels using MoSCoW method.
  6. Develop a wireframes of the potential app.
  7. Select colours for the app.
  8. Select fonts for the app.

[Github Kanban board can be found following this link](https://github.com/users/SamMartin92/projects/6)

While some variations can be visible in end product, we believe planning helped us to successfully work on this project and we tried to stay with choices made during planning stage.
