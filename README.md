## **Intro**

Valentine Ventures is an app designed to offer the user a list of romantic places to take your loved one anywhere in the world. The site offers the user the option to type in a country name in a text box or click on a map to select destinations within the country. Once the country has been selected a number of locations are offered and again these locations can be selected via form or map to find specific locations in this city ore area. The site displays a number of locations with an image and information about the site. The user can then select a specific location and more detailed information is presented about the particular site. This site also offers reviews about the site and allows the user to inter their own review after their visit to a specific location.
